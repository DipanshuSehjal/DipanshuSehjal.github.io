	<br>An Android application that helps you track your valuables. It is an application designed to solve the everyday problem that most of us run through. The agonizing pain that we undergo when we lose our valuables is horrific. Not to forget the costs attached to replace the lost item, scolding from your mom or even your children (How can you lose the keys to our car? How will we go home now?), and the stigma that you will carry for the next couple of days. 

<br><br>

The idea is to connect the item, which can be an ID card or keys or a wallet that we think are endangered to misplacement/lost, with our mobile so that we can track where our belongings, real-time.
<br><br>
Example case: Someone loses their ID card. 'Fret not someone!', you can track where your card is at the moment. He/she uses the application to find where the card, real-time.
<br><br>

Some thoughts about design and features, especially privacy:<br>
<p>1. First, the item has to be registered with application installed in the Owners (not users) mobile phone.</p>
2. The item is enabled with a GPS and a small computer that connects this item to the internet and is only accessible with the owner's request. No privacy breach.</p>
3. The item is in an inactive mode when not being tracked. It switches to active mode when enabled by the owner initialized with a request.</p>


<p style="margin-left: -15px;">The design is aimed to ease our lives and live free without worrying too much about our dreaded careless attitude.</p>
